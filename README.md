# hello-world
This is my first github project

My name is Chris and while I have tried to learn programming and web development in the past, it has always confused. I do minor stuff for companies, but now that I am starting to scale, things are starting to break. I decided to learn industry best practices and industry standards so I can better learn to code, develop a project and be more valuable to my team. This is the first time I have ever used github.
